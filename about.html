        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The Voyager Archives was created in order to preserve the history and collective knowledge of the Space Simulation Center community. With over 25 years of creativity and history, the knowledge and ideas which have been developed for various Space Simulation Centers has never been documented in a centralized place. This is a source of ideas and experiences can be built upon and shared by anyone who wants to contribute to the Space Simulation Center community. This website fulfills that need by providing Do-It-Yourself Instructibles, various troubleshooting guides, wikis, and more in order to share openly the creativity at the Space Center.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Space Center</h3>
        <p>The Original Space Simulation Center was founded in 1990 by <a href="https://renacademy.org/victor-williamson">Victor Williamson</a> and was called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christa_McAuliffe_Space_Education_Center">Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center</a>. It started out with it's first Space Simulator called "The USS Voyager". This center has been operating for over 25 years, and has hosted over 300,000 students during school year field trips alone. Many people have had their lives changed by going through this program. It continues to live on in its original incarnation at Central Elementary School, but is has also spread to a variety of other schools throughout Utah and other states. For a list of other Space Simulation Centers based off of the original Voyager Concept, and updated information about them, see the <a href="http://voyagerarchives.com/News/index.html">News Section</a>.</p>
